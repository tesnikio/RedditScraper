# RedditScraper

Since I had a little amount of time, for convenience reasons I chose [PRAW Wrapper for Reddit](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) post scraping. 
To set things up, you'll have to install PRAW and create a Reddit application in your account as a developer.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install praw
$ pip install --upgrade praw
```

## Data Scraping

After PRAW installation I wrote a small Python script for collecting some data. I chose a period from the 1st of November 2020 to the start of January 2021 (2 months). Data can be found in the "data" folder.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here I used Jupyter Notebook with internal comments (read inside) to conveniently demonstrate the data. I used Pandas for table data, Seaborn and Matplotlib for plotting, and Numpy for math and statistics.
